This Chrome extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data or browsing information.

Data Collection

The extension operates entirely locally in the user's browser. It does not send any data to external servers, does not track users, and does not use analytics, cookies, or advertising services.

Permissions Usage

The extension requires certain browser permissions strictly to provide its functionality:

activeTab: Used only to access the currently active tab when the user activates the extension.

storage: Used only to store local extension state such as user settings and runtime flags.

host permissions: Used only to interact with the web page content where the extension is enabled.

scripting: Used only to inject the content script on user request.

No data obtained through these permissions is collected, transmitted, or shared.

Third-Party Libraries

The extension uses open-source libraries (such as html2canvas and Matter.js) that run locally within the browser and do not transmit data externally.
