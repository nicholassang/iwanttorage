## To Note
Performance of widget conversion to breakable object dpends on your PC's capabilities, there may be some bugs but nothing groundbreaking. A quick reload and toggling of the web extension usually does the trick 👍

There are some widgets which the web extension cannot convert, because its a restricted site reserved for Google or the widgets are designed to be guarded against web scraping, security hacks... the web extension does it's best within its capabilities.
